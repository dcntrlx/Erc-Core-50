# ERC Core 50
This is a collection of the most actual and popular ERCs on today.
The collection is splitted in two parts:
1. **Deep Dives [`/Deep`](Deep)**: In-depth analysis, implementation details, and deep mechanics.
2. **Overview [`/Overview`](Overview)**: Quick overview on the other ERCs.
In the future information about every single ERCs will be extended and thus they will be moved from `/Overview` to `/Deep`.

## ERCs List
### [ERC165](Deep/ERC165.md) (Interface Detection)  
Standardizes the concept of interfaces and standardizes the identification (naming) of interfaces. Creates a standard method to publish and detect what interfaces a smart contract implements.
