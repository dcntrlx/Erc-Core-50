# ERC5192
**Created**: 2022-06-01

**Description**:
- Standardizes "Soulbound" (non-transferable) tokens within the ERC-721 framework.
- Provides a minimal interface to check if a token is locked to its owner.

**Motivation**: To create a canonical, widely recognized way to define non-transferable assets (like credentials or reputation) so that wallets and marketplaces can prevent failed transfer attempts.

## Core Concept: Minimal Soulbound NFTs
Before ERC-5192, "Soulbound" tokens were just broken ERC-721s that reverted on transfer. This was bad for UX because wallets didn't know they were broken until the user paid for a failed transaction.
ERC-5192 adds a standard "flag" (`locked`) that tells the world: "This token cannot be moved."

### The Interface
A contract compliant with ERC-5192 must implement the following interface:

```solidity
interface IERC5192 {
    /// @notice Emitted when the locking status is changed to locked.
    /// @dev If a token is minted and the status is locked, this event should be emitted.
    event Locked(uint256 tokenId);

    /// @notice Emitted when the locking status is changed to unlocked.
    event Unlocked(uint256 tokenId);

    /// @notice Returns the locking status of an Soulbound Token
    /// @dev SBTs assigned to zero address are considered invalid, and queries about them do throw.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier for an SBT.
    function locked(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### Interface Identification
The ERC-165 interface identifier for ERC5192 is `0xb45a3c0e`.
Contracts compatible with ERCh5192 must return true for `supportsInterface(0xb45a3c0e)`.

## Implementation Details
### 1. The locked Function
- Returns true: The token is Soulbound. Any attempt to transfer it (via transferFrom or safeTransferFrom) MUST revert.
- Returns false: The token acts like a normal ERC-721 and can be transferred thats the reason why soulbound tokens are compatible with ERC721

### 2. Events (Locked & Unlocked)
- These events are critical for off-chain indexers (like Etherscan or OpenSea).
- If a token is minted directly into a locked state, the Locked event should be emitted during minting.

### 3. Mutability
ERC-5192 allows for dynamic locking:
- A token can start as transferable and become locked later.
- A token can be locked and later unlocked.
