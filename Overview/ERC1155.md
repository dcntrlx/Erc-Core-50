# ERC-1155: Multi Token Standard
**Source:** [EIP-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)

## Summary
A standard for contracts managing multiple token types (Fungible, NFT, Semi-Fungible) in a single contract.

## Key Features
1.  **Multi-Token:** One contract can manage thousands of different tokens.
    -   **Mechanism:** Uses a `uint256 id` to distinguish token types.
    -   **Storage:** Typically uses a mapping like `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) balances` (Token ID -> Owner -> Balance).
    -   **Flexibility:**
        -   If supply is `1` (and unique): Acts like an NFT (ERC-721).
        -   If supply is `>1`: Acts like a Fungible Token (ERC-20).
    -   **Collections:** Unlike ERC-721 where the *contract* is the collection, in ERC-1155 the *contract* holds many different items. Thus there are no collections in ERC-1155. Each `id` is a separate token type. You can logically group IDs (e.g. 1-100) to simulate collections, but the standard treats them independently.
    -   **Scope:** Manages only tokens created *within* this contract. It cannot directly manage or transfer tokens from other external ERC-20 or ERC-721 contracts.
2.  **Batch Operations:**
    -   `safeBatchTransferFrom`: Transfer multiple token types in one transaction.
    -   `balanceOfBatch`: Query multiple balances in one call.
3.  **Efficiency:** Reduces gas costs and bytecode by avoiding separate contracts per token.
4.  **Metadata:** Uses a single URI with `{id}` substitution (e.g., `api/item/{id}.json`) for all tokens.
5.  **Safe Transfers:** Requires recipient contracts to implement `onERC1155Received` hooks.

## Core Interface
```solidity
interface ERC1155 {
    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata accounts, uint256[] calldata ids) external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) external view returns (bool);
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] calldata ids, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```
