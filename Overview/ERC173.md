# [ERC173](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-173)
**Created:** 2018-06-07
**Description:** A standard interface for ownership managing for contracts. It provides a standardized way to manage and transfer administrative control.

### Methods
#### Required Methods
1.  **`owner`**
    ```solidity
    function owner() external view returns (address)
    ```
    Returns the address of the current contract owner.

2.  **`transferOwnership`**
    ```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external
    ```
    Sets the address of the new owner of the contract.
    - Set `_newOwner` to `address(0)` to renounce any ownership.
    - MUST emit the `OwnershipTransferred` event.
    - The function SHOULD throw if the caller is not the current owner.

### Events
1.  **`OwnershipTransferred`**
    ```solidity
    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner)
    ```
    - MUST trigger when ownership is transferred.
    - MUST trigger when a contract is created (with `previousOwner` set to `0x0`).

## Implementation
This standard is widely adopted and is the basis for the `Ownable` pattern found in OpenZeppelin and many other libraries.

## Dangerous ways to interact
The basic `transferOwnership` is immediate. If you send it to the wrong address, it's gone forever.
*Best Practice*: Use a "Two-Step Transfer" pattern (Offer + Accept) on top of this standard.

## Renouncing
Setting the owner to `address(0)` effectively "burns" the key, making the contract trustless and immutable (no one can call admin functions anymore).

## OpenZeppelin Implementation
OpenZeppelin's `Ownable.sol` is the reference implementation for this standard.
- It implements `owner()` and `transferOwnership()`.
- It adds a `renounceOwnership()` helper function (which calls `transferOwnership(address(0))`).
- It adds a `onlyOwner` modifier to easily protect functions.
