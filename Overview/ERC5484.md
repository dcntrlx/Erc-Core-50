# ERC5484
Created: 2022-08
Description: A standard interface for "Consensual" Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) that defines who has the authority to burn (revoke) the token: the issuer, the holder, both, or neither.

## Core Concepts

-   **ERC-721**: Transferable.
-   **ERC-5192**: Minimal SBT interface (Locked/Unlocked status).
-   **ERC-5484**: Detailed SBT interface with granular Burn Permissions.


"Soulbound" tokens (non-transferable NFTs) are used for identity, credentials, and reputation. However, standard ERC-721 doesn't define who can remove the token.

### Burn Authorization
ERC-5484 standardizes the "Burn Authorization" policy for each token.
1.  **Consensual**: The standard emphasizes that the receiver should consent to receiving the token (though enforcing this is up to the implementation).
2.  **Immutable Policy**: The burn policy is set at minting and cannot be changed.

## Methods

```solidity
enum BurnAuth { IssuerOnly, OwnerOnly, Both, Neither }

function burnAuth(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (BurnAuth);
```
-   **IssuerOnly**: Only the contract owner (issuer) can burn. (Example: Loan record).
-   **OwnerOnly**: Only the token holder can burn. (Example: Paid membership).
-   **Both**: Either can burn. (Example: Credentials).
-   **Neither**: No one can burn. (Example: Permanent credit history).

### Events
```solidity
event Issued(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId, BurnAuth burnAuth);
```
-   Emitted alongside the standard ERC-721 `Transfer` event during minting. This signals to indexers that this is a Soulbound Token and declares its burn policy.

## Implementation Details

### Key Rotation
Since SBTs are non-transferable, losing keys is a risk. The `BurnAuth` allows for key rotation strategies:
-   If `BurnAuth` is `Both` or `IssuerOnly`, the user can ask the issuer to burn the old token and re-issue it to a new wallet.

## Risks and standard "ifs"
1.  **Spam**: If `BurnAuth` is `IssuerOnly` or `Neither`, users cannot remove unwanted tokens from their wallet. Wallets may need to implement "Hide" features.
2.  **Consent**: The standard mentions "Consensual" but cannot strictly enforce off-chain consent. It is up to the issuer to ensure the user wants the token.
