# ERC-1167: Minimal Proxy Contract
**Created:** 2018-06-22

Description: A standard for deploying extremely cheap "Clone" contracts that delegate all logic to a Master Implementation.

## Core Concept
Deploying a large smart contract (like a Uniswap Pair or a Gnosis Safe) is expensive because you pay gas for every byte of code.
If you need to deploy thousands of these contracts (e.g., one wallet per user), the costs become prohibitive.

ERC-1167 solves this by creating a Minimal Proxy:
1.  Master Implementation: You deploy the heavy logic contract once.
2.  Clones: You deploy tiny "proxy" contracts that point to the Master.
3.  Delegation: When a user interacts with a Clone, the Clone simply says: *"I don't have code. Go execute the code at the Master address, but use MY storage."*

## The Mechanism: "The 45-Byte Trick"
The standard defines a specific, optimized bytecode (only 45 bytes long!) that does exactly one thing:
`DELEGATECALL` to a fixed address.

## Features
*   Gas Savings: Deploying a Clone costs ~45,000 gas (Base 32k + ~200 gas/byte). It is effectively the cheapest way to deploy a fully functional contract that delegates logic. A full contract deployment often costs millions.
*   Standardization: Because the bytecode is standardized, block explorers (like Etherscan) can automatically detect it. They show you the "Read/Write Contract" interface of the Master, even though you are looking at the Clone.
*   Immutability: Unlike "Upgradable Proxies" (ERC-1967), an ERC-1167 Clone is usually immutable. It points to one Master forever. This is a feature, not a bug—it guarantees trustlessness.

## Summary
ERC-1167 is the industry standard for "Factory" patterns. It allows you to spawn unlimited copies of a contract for a fraction of the cost, enabling scalable dApps that require unique on-chain state for every user or entity.
