# [ERC7540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7540)
Created: 2023-08-18
Description: An extension of the ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault standard designed to handle asynchronous deposits and redemptions.

### Overview
ERC-7540 standardizes the process for vaults where settlement isn't immediate. Instead of swapping Asset -> Share instantly, you submit a request, wait for the vault to process it (e.g., selling a real estate asset or bridging funds), and then claim your funds later.

The original ERC-4626 standard assumes atomicity. This breaks in three major scenarios:
1. Real World Assets (RWAs): Settlement often takes 1-2 days (fiat wire transfers).
2. Cross-Chain Yield: Bridging funds to another chain takes time (minutes to hours).
3. Liquid Staking: Unstaking ETH often takes days (queue system).

ERC-7540 separates the "User Intent" from the "Execution."

#### The Lifecycle
1. Request: The user calls `requestDeposit` or `requestRedeem`. Assets move to the vault, but no shares are minted yet.
2. Pending: The request enters a queue. The Vault Operator processes the backend logic.
3. Claimable: Once settled, the vault updates the state. The request moves from "Pending" to "Claimable."
4. Claimed: The user calls `deposit` or `redeem` to finalize and receive tokens.

### Technical Implementation
ERC-7540 adds new methods on top of ERC-4626.

| Action | Standard ERC-4626 | Asynchronous ERC-7540 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Input | `deposit(assets, receiver)` | `requestDeposit(assets, controller, owner)` |
| Output | `redeem(shares, receiver, owner)` | `requestRedeem(shares, controller, owner)` |
| Check Status | N/A (Instant) | `pendingDepositRequest(requestID)` |
| Finalize | N/A (Instant) | `claimDeposit(requestID)` |
