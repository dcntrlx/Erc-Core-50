# ERC5313
Created: 2022-07
Description: A minimalist interface for identifying the owner of a contract, serving as a lighter alternative to ERC-173.

## Core Concepts

### The Problem: Heavy Standards
ERC-173 is the standard for "Ownable" contracts. It requires:
1.  owner() view function.
2.  transferOwnership() function.
3.  OwnershipTransferred event.
4.  ERC-165 support.

Many contracts (like NFTs on marketplaces) just need to *display* who the owner is. They don't need a standardized way to *transfer* ownership (which might be complex or impossible for some governance contracts).

### The Solution: Light Ownership
ERC-5313 defines the absolute minimum required to identify an owner: a single owner() function.

## Methods

```solidity
function owner() external view returns (address);
```
-   Returns the address of the account that controls the contract.

### Detaied
ERC-5313 is a subset of ERC-173.
-   Every ERC-173 contract is automatically ERC-5313 compliant.
-   OpenZeppelin's Ownable is automatically ERC-5313 compliant.

ERC-5313 does *not* require ERC-165. This means you cannot use supportsInterface to check if a contract is ERC-5313 compliant. You must try calling owner() and see if it reverts.
