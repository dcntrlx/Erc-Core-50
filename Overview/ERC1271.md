ERC-1271: Standard Signature Validation Method for Contracts
Source: EIP-1271

Summary:
A standard allowing Smart Contracts to verify signatures.

Why We Need It:
ERC-1271 is the **"translation layer"** for the "Off-Chain Web." Smart Contracts lack private keys, so they can't natively sign (the "Private Key Paradox"). This standard lets them define **programmable validity** (e.g., "Valid if 2/3 owners signed"), unlocking **gasless capabilities** like OpenSea bids and Logins. It gives Smart Wallets the "credit card" (signature) power of normal users but with custom security logic.

Interface:
function isValidSignature(bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature) external view returns (bytes4 magicValue);

Mechanism:
1. **User Signs:** You (EOA) sign a hash with your private key off-chain.
2. **dApp Asks Wallet:** The dApp calls `isValidSignature` on your Smart Wallet.
3. **Wallet Checks:** The wallet runs logic: "Did one of my authorized owners sign this?"
    -   *Why?* Because the dApp trusts the **Wallet** (where the assets are), not your private key. The wallet must confirm it approves this action.
4. **Output:** Returns Magic Value `0x1626ba7e` if approved.

Key Use Case:
 It enables Smart Contract Wallets to hold your assets and still interact with dApps.
-   Without ERC-1271, a contract holding your NFTs couldn't list them on OpenSea because it couldn't produce the required signature.
Difference vs Direct Calls:
- **Direct Call (Action):** You trigger your wallet to execute a function on another contract. This happens **on-chain** and costs gas immediately.
- **ERC-1271 (Intent):** You want to **prove permission** without executing a transaction yet.
    -   *Example:* Logging into a website, listing an NFT for sale, or voting in a snapshot.
    -   These require a **signature**, not a transaction. ERC-1271 allows your contract to provide that signature.

What happens next?
1.  **Submission:** You send the signature to a dApp (e.g., OpenSea).
2.  **Verification:** The dApp calls `isValidSignature` on your wallet contract.
3.  **Result:** If your wallet confirms the signature is valid (returns magic value), the dApp accepts your login or order.
