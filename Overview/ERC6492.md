# ERC-6492: Signature Validation for Pre-deploy Contracts
Created: 2023-02-16

Description: A standard to verify signatures from smart contracts that don't exist yet on-chain.

## Core Concept
This standard enables signature verification for **Counterfactual Smart Wallets**—wallets that have a deterministic address and a key, but have not yet been deployed to the blockchain.

## Mechanism
The verification process follows a 4-step logic:
1.  **Check for Magic Bytes:** The signature is checked for a specific suffix. If present, it indicates the signature contains "deployment blueprints" (`factoryCalldata`).
2.  **Simulation:** The verifier uses `eth_call` to create a temporary execution sandbox.
3.  **Deploy and Verify:** Inside this sandbox, the wallet is deployed using the provided factory data, and `isValidSignature` is immediately called on the newly created contract.
4.  **Result:** The process returns a `true/false` validity result, and the sandbox state is discarded.

> **Note on Factories:** This mechanism **requires** the wallet to be deployable via a Factory contract. The "blueprint" provided in the signature is literally a call to this Factory (`factoryAddress` + `factoryCalldata`) to execute the `CREATE2` deployment. Without a factory, there is no way to deterministically simulate the deployment.

## Key Distinctions
*   **Simulation vs. Reality:** Checking a signature **does not** deploy the contract to Mainnet. The process occurs in a read-only simulation using `eth_call`. It costs **0 gas** and leaves the address empty on-chain.
*   **View Safety:** The `isValidSignature` function is `external view` (enforced via `STATICCALL`). This ensures the verification process is strictly **read-only** and cannot modify state or move funds.

## Use Case: Lazy Deployment
This mechanism enables **Lazy Deployment**. Users can generate a wallet address, login to dApps, and receive funds without paying gas. The deployment gas cost is deferred until the user executes their first outbound transaction.
