# ERC-2981: NFT Royalty Standard
**Created:** 2020-09-15


**Description:** A standardized way for NFTs to signal how much royalty should be paid on secondary sales.

## Core Concept
Before ERC-2981, every marketplace (OpenSea, Rarible, etc.) had its own custom way of handling royalties. If you sold an NFT on a different platform than where it was minted, the creator often got **zero** royalties.

ERC-2981 solves this by adding a single function to the NFT contract itself. It acts as a "price tag" for royalties that any marketplace can read.

## The Interface
The standard defines a single function:

```solidity
function royaltyInfo(
    uint256 _tokenId,
    uint256 _salePrice
) external view returns (
    address receiver,
    uint256 royaltyAmount
);
```

### Inputs
*   `_tokenId`: Which specific NFT is being sold?
*   `_salePrice`: How much is it being sold for? (e.g., 100 ETH)

### Outputs
*   `receiver`: Who gets the money? (The creator or a treasury).
*   `royaltyAmount`: How much should they get? (e.g., 5 ETH).

## Key Features

### 1. "Signal, Not Force"
This standard **does not enforce payment**.
*   **Why?** The NFT contract cannot distinguish between a "Sale" (User A buys from User B) and a "Transfer" (User A moves to their Ledger).
*   **Result:** It is up to the **Marketplace** to call `royaltyInfo` and voluntarily honor the payment. If a sale happens OTC (Over-the-Counter), the standard cannot force the royalty.

### 2. Unit Agnostic
The standard doesn't care about currency.
*   If `_salePrice` is 100 ETH, `royaltyAmount` is returned in ETH.
*   If `_salePrice` is 1000 USDC, `royaltyAmount` is returned in USDC.
*   The math is simple: `royaltyAmount` is usually a percentage of `_salePrice`.

### 3. Dynamic Logic
Because `royaltyInfo` is a function (not just a variable), you can program complex logic:
*   **Decaying Royalties:** 10% for the first year, 5% after.
*   **Dynamic Receivers:** Royalties go to different people based on the Token ID.
*   **Linear Curves:** Royalties decrease as the sale price increases.

## Rationale
*   **Why return an Amount and not a Percentage?**
    *   To avoid rounding errors and disputes. If the contract calculates the exact amount, the marketplace doesn't need to do any math. It just pays what it's told.
*   **Why not built into `transferFrom`?**
    *   Gas costs. Checking royalties on every transfer would make moving NFTs expensive, even when no money is changing hands.

## Summary
ERC-2981 is the "Universal Adapter" for royalties. It allows any marketplace to support royalties for any NFT collection without custom integration code.
