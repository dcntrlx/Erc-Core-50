# ERC725
Created: 2017-10
Description: A standard for a "Blockchain Account" that combines a flexible key-value store (ERC725Y) with a generic execution interface (ERC725X).

## Core Concepts

### The Problem: Rigid Accounts
Standard EOAs (private key wallets) have no metadata (no name, no avatar) and cannot execute complex logic (batching, multi-sig). Smart contract wallets exist, but they often lack a standard way to store data or execute arbitrary actions.

### The Solution: The Proxy Account
ERC-725 defines a smart contract account with two distinct capabilities:
1.  **ERC725X (Execution)**: The ability to call other contracts, deploy contracts, or transfer assets.
2.  **ERC725Y (Storage)**: A generic key-value store to hold metadata (like "Name", "Avatar", "Social Links") directly on-chain.

## Methods

### ERC725X: Execution
```solidity
function execute(uint256 operationType, address target, uint256 value, bytes memory data) external payable returns (bytes memory);
function executeBatch(uint256[] memory operationTypes, address[] memory targets, uint256[] memory values, bytes[] memory datas) external payable returns (bytes[] memory);
```
-   **operationType**: Defines the action:
    -   `0`: Call (Standard interaction)
    -   `1`: Create (Deploy contract)
    -   `2`: Create2 (Deterministic deploy)
    -   `3`: StaticCall (Read-only)
    -   `4`: DelegateCall (Execute code in context of account)
-   **executeBatch**: Allows performing multiple actions in one transaction (e.g., Approve + Swap).

### ERC725Y: Data Store
```solidity
function setData(bytes32 dataKey, bytes memory dataValue) external;
function getData(bytes32 dataKey) external view returns (bytes memory);
```
-   **dataKey**: A 32-byte hash identifying the data (e.g., `keccak256("MyProfileImage")`).
-   **dataValue**: The raw bytes of the data.

## Implementation Details

### The "Universal Profile"
ERC-725 is the foundation of the "Universal Profile" (LSP standards). It allows an identity to persist across dApps.
-   Instead of your identity being a row in a centralized database, it is a smart contract you own.
-   You can attach arbitrary data to your identity using `setData`.

### Ownership
The contract typically has an `owner` (often a Key Manager contract) that is authorized to call `execute` and `setData`. This allows for complex access control (e.g., "Device A can only update the avatar, Device B can transfer funds").
