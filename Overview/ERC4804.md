# ERC4804
Created: 2022-02
Description: A standard for Web3 URLs, allowing users to access on-chain content (HTML, SVG, JSON) directly via a browser-friendly `web3://` protocol.

ERC-4804 defines a standard way to translate a URL into an EVM contract call.
1.  Direct Rendering: Browsers can render the output of a smart contract function as a webpage.
2.  Decentralized Hosting: Frontends can be stored entirely on-chain and accessed without DNS or AWS.

## Methods

### URL Structure
The standard defines the `web3://` schema:
`web3://<contract_address>:<chain_id>/<method>/<arg1>?<query>`
-   contract_address: The target smart contract (or ENS name).
-   chain_id: The network to query (defaults to mainnet).
-   method: The function to call (defaults to `resolveMode` logic).
-   args: Parameters passed to the function.

### Resolution Logic
The protocol translates the URL into a read-only EVM call.
1.  Parse the URL.
2.  Resolve ENS to address (if needed).
3.  Construct the calldata based on the method and arguments.
4.  Call the contract.
5.  Render the returned data (MIME type detection).

## Implementation Details

### The Resolve Mode
Contracts can implement a `resolveMode` method to tell the client how to handle requests.
-   Auto: The client tries to auto-detect the method (e.g., `index.html` -> `index()`).
-   Manual: The contract handles the raw path and query explicitly via a `resolve(bytes)` function.

### MIME Types
The returned data is interpreted like an HTTP response. If the contract returns `<!DOCTYPE html>...`, the browser renders it as a website.
Problme is Gas Costs: Reading data is free (view call), but storing the HTML/SVG on-chain is expensive. This is best suited for L2s or generative content.
