# [ERC2309](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309)
Created: 2019-08-30


Description: A standard for minting/transferring millions of NFTs in one transaction. It solves the "Gas Limit" problem when batch minting ERC-721 tokens.

### Overview
In standard ERC-721, every single token transfer must emit a `Transfer` event.
If minting 10,000 NFTs to a user:
1. loop 10,000 times
2. emit 10,000 events
3. hit the Block Gas Limit and the transaction fails

ERC-2309 introduces a new event that says "Tokens X through Y were moved," effectively compressing thousands of events into one.

> This standardonly defines the Event for off-chain indexers (like Etherscan). It does NOT define a `batchMint` function. You must write your own logic to update storage efficiently.

### The Solution
The standard defines a single event: `ConsecutiveTransfer`.

#### 1. The Event
```solidity
event ConsecutiveTransfer(
    uint256 indexed fromTokenId,
    uint256 toTokenId,
    address indexed fromAddress,
    address indexed toAddress
);
```
Instead of saying "Transfer ID 1", "Transfer ID 2", "Transfer ID 3"...
It says: "Transfer IDs 1 through 10000 from 0x0 to Alice".

### Technical Implementation
To use this, your contract must:
1. Emit `ConsecutiveTransfer` instead of `Transfer` when doing batches.
2. NOT emit individual `Transfer` events for the same tokens (to avoid duplication)

```solidity
// Example
function batchMint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    uint256 startId = _nextTokenId();
    uint256 endId = startId + amount - 1;

    // Update internal state once
    _balances[to] += amount;
    
    // Emit ONE event for 5000 tokens
    emit ConsecutiveTransfer(startId, endId, address(0), to);
}
```
