# [ERC6372](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6372)
Created: 2023-01-25
Description: A standard for Contract Clock. It allows smart contracts to tell the world how they track time (Block Number vs Timestamp).

### Overview
Contracts use either Block Number or Timestamp to track time. This ambiguity breaks interoperability (e.g., Governance contracts reading Token balances). ERC-6372 standardizes how contracts report their time source.

### The Solution
The standard requires two functions:
1. clock(): Returns the current timepoint (uint48).
   - uint48 used because its fits in a storage slot with an address (160+48=208 bits) for gas savings, yet lasts for millions of years.*
2. CLOCK_MODE(): Returns a string describing the mode (e.g., "mode=timestamp").

### Technical Implementation
```solidity
// Example of a Timestamp-based clock
function clock() public view override returns (uint48) {
    return uint48(block.timestamp); // For blocks: uint48(block.number)
}

function CLOCK_MODE() public pure override returns (string memory) {
    return "mode=timestamp"; // For blocks: "mode=blocknumber&from=default" (default means from genesis) We can have clock that counts from specific block height by specifind number after &from=
}
```

### Solves poblems for
1.Cross-Chain: L2 block times vary; timestamps are universal.
2.Governance: Ensures voting snapshots align (Block vs Time).
